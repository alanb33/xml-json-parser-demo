# xml-json-parser-demo
A demo XML to JSON parser written in Python.

Initial data sample (breakfast_menu.xml) was sourced from W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_examples.asp). Specifically, the three samples are the XML CD Catalog (https://www.w3schools.com/xml/cd_catalog.xml), the XML plant catalog (https://www.w3schools.com/xml/plant_catalog.xml), and the XML food catalog (https://www.w3schools.com/xml/simple.xml).
